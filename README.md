#Dataset Dimension:
Train set = 188318 x 132
Test set = 125546 x 131


Total no of feature = 130 (Regressor) + 1 (Target)
Categorical feature = 116
Numerical feature = 14

#After applying one-hot encoding:
shape of data (Train) = 188318 x 1037
shape of data (Test) = 125546 x 1037
Total no of feature = 1037 (Regressor) + 1 (Target)
One-hot encoded feature = 1023
Numerical Feature = 14

#After applying PCA for dimensionality reduction:
Shape of the data = 188318 x 300
